For the second iteration of my website I decided to take the opportunity to learn a little bit of react and typescript. My website has been rebuilt from the ground up with new code, a new look, and room for even more growth in the future. Overall there is still a lot of areas to tinker with and improve such as the responsive aspect of the site and a few style details, however overall I am excited to present this new version!
