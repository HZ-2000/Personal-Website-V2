For the second iteration of my website I decided to take the opportunity to learn a little bit of react and typescript. My website has been rebuilt from the ground up with new code, a new look, and room for even more growth in the future. Another new addition is a CGOL (Conway's game of life) page with a working version of the game, it is quite fun to play around with and has a few templates to help get you started. Overall there is still a lot of areas to tinker with and improve such as the responsive aspect of the site and a few style details, however overall I am excited to present this new version!
